Functional Requirements
Your main menu should include the following operations:

Register Patient (Enqueue):

Ask for the patient's Name and Age.

Add them to the end of the line.

Serve Patient (Dequeue):

Call the next patient in line.

Display their name ("Now serving: John Doe").

Remove them from the list and free the memory associated with that node.

If the line is empty, display "No patients waiting."

Emergency Admit (Push Front):

Ask for Name and Age.

This patient skips the line and is added to the very front of the list (Head).

View Line:

Print the current list of waiting patients in order.

Display the total count of patients waiting.

Close Clinic (Exit):

When the user chooses to exit, the program must ensure all remaining patients in the list are removed and their memory is free()'d before the program terminates.
